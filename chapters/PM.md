# Product Management 101

## What is product management?

Product management is a function of an organization that involves guiding teams on a product's lifecycle, from development to execution, by focusing on exactly what (potential) customers want. While product managers are champions of the product, they are also understanding the competitive landscape, learning about its users, and devising new solutions for improvement.

Because every product is different, the role of a product manager is also very dynamic. For one company, product management might involve research and development of a new product. For others, it might be the relaunch and repositioning of an old product. No matter what, product management refers to delivering excellence at all points of a product's lifecycle.

Product management exists at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience (UX) design. It often requires developing strong relationships with cross-functional teams in order to plan ahead and bolster a product's success.

The role used to be situated on marketing or engineering teams, but in recent years, tech companies have begun to realize the importance of product management as its own team. There will often be one product manager for each product or service within a company.

## What does a product manager do?

A product manager is a professional who defines the strategy, roadmap, features, and success of a product. They help set goals and motivate the product team of engineers, designers, marketers, and researchers, with the primary concern of ensuring that a product launches and continues to do well in the market.

Product managers stay on top of business and consumer trends and behaviors that directly or indirectly affect the product or company. Day-to-day responsibilities may include:

- Analyzing, understanding, and representing user needs
- Monitoring the market landscape to develop competitive analysis
- Defining the vision for a product, such as a multi-year roadmap of its development, packaging, launch, and expansion
- Coordinating and communicating about the product's vision with management, product teams, and other stakeholders
- Gathering and conducting research and feedback on the product
- Guiding teams through the entire product lifecycle

## Skills needed to become a product manager

Successful product managers are keenly aware of trends on the market and instinctively know what would make a product or service better or better suited for a particular customer group. If you're interested in becoming a product manager, set yourself up for success by developing these key skills:

- Communication skills help you collaborate with company stakeholders, executives, and product teams, absorb product market feedback, and convey the appropriate information and vision to the right people at the right time
- Strategic thinking is imperative to be able to prioritize and implement ideas that can best affect the company or brand
- Management skills empower you to help individuals and teams perform at their highest levels
- Technical skills equip you to understand what goes into designing a product or service
- User empathy helps to identify and evaluate challenges users may have with the product
- Project management to ensure marketing, design, engineers, and other stakeholders are aligned on the product's vision and can carry out that vision in a timely, organized manner

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are defined as the conditions that must be satisfied for a product, user story, or increment of work to be accepted. While not a part of the Scrum Guide, AC can be a useful tool teams may choose to use to improve the quality of product backlog items.

Acceptance criteria do not focus on “how” a solution is reached or “how” something is made. Instead, they illuminate the “what” of the work you are doing. For example, the criteria may be:
Users can pay with Google Pay or Apple Pay at checkout.

The spirit of acceptance criteria is not to tell you how to do it, for example:
Install a Wordpress plugin that allows you to create a checkout page.
Or -
Write HTML that makes it possible to pay with Apple Pay or Google Pay.

## Acceptance Criteria vs. User Stories: What’s the Difference?

Acceptance criteria are not the same thing as a user story. Instead, they complement one another.

A user story is a brief description of your customer's needs, written from their perspective. It describes their goal or problem they’re trying to solve. The acceptance criteria are what should be done to solve their problem or achieve their goal.

In this way, the user story describes the “why” of the work, while the acceptance criteria describe the “what.” The “how” is decided by developers as they work through the sprint.

## How to Write Acceptance Criteria
Templated approaches to writing the criteria can be found across the internet. When it comes to the Scrum Guide, there is no guidance because these criteria are separate from the lightweight framework of scrum. Try different formats – either custom or from a template – and see what works well for your team.

Use a bullet list, checklist, or verification list.

Use the scenario-based template.
Other agile teams will use a format known as scenario-based, in which you use a formula: Given that; when; then:

Given (some given context or precondition), when (I take this action), then this will be the result

## What Are Some Examples of Acceptance Criteria?
For a checkout page on a store’s website:

PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and all major credit cards can be used to complete the transaction
Shopping cart item(s) are displayed
Items can be deleted from the shopping cart
User is prompted to log in if they aren’t already

## Acceptance Criteria vs. Definition of Done
While it’s true that both DoD and acceptance criteria indicate a done state, they aren’t quite the same.

The definition of done is typically expressed as a list of statements that must be met in order to call the work potentially shippable or to otherwise declare that work complete. The big difference is that the same DoD applies to every product backlog item and does not change between items.

Here is an example of DoD:

Code is completed
Tested
No defects
Live on production

## The Value of Acceptance Criteria to Agile Organizations
Acceptance criteria benefit agile teams and scrum teams because the criteria:

Create a clear line of understanding from end user to product owner to developers
Let the developers know exactly what they need to accomplish during the sprint
Can be created quickly and concisely, supporting the value of working software over comprehensive documentation (while also supplying documentation if it is needed for compliance in your industry)
Create clarity and reduces ambiguity so that a self-managing development team can do their work efficiently
Reduce the odds that your customer will feel their expectations were unfulfilled
Provide criteria for testing the product

## User Stories

Definition: A user story is a small, self-contained unit of development work designed to accomplish a specific goal within a product. A user story is usually written from the user’s perspective and follows the format: 

“As [a user persona], I want [to perform this action] so that [I can accomplish this goal].”
