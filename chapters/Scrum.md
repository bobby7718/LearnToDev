# Scrum Basics

## Scrum Definition

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
- A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
- The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
- Repeat

Scrum is simple.

## Scrum Team

- Developers
  - Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
  - Developers are always accountable for:
    - Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
    - Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
    - Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
    - Holding each other accountable as professionals.
- Product Owner
  - The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
  - The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:
    - Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
    - Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
    - Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
    - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.
    - The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.

- Scrum Master
  - The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
  - The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Teamâ€™s effectiveness.
  - Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

## Product Backlog Refinement

## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. 
This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal. 
The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?
Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?
Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?

## Sprint Backlog Grooming

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), 
the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), 
as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

- User Story Acceptance Criteria
- Definition of Ready

## Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. 
To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. 
If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

- What I did yesterday
- What I'm doing today
- Any blocker ?

## Sprint Review

- The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. 
- The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
- Sprint demo

## Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

- What did well
- What didn't go well
- What we could do differently

How often ?
